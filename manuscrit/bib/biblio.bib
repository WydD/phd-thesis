@techreport{Arasu:semantic,
abstract = {Despite the recent surge of research in query processing over data streams, little attention has been devoted to defining precise semantics for continuous queries over streams. We first present an abstract semantics based on several building blocks: formal definitions for streams and relations, mappings among them, and any relational query language. From these basics we define a precise interpretation for continuous queries over streams and relations. We then propose a concrete language, CQL (for Continuous Query Language), which instantiates the abstract semantics using SQL as the relational query language and window specifications derived from SQL-99 to map from streams to relations. We identify some equivalences that can be used to rewrite CQL queries for optimization, and we discuss some additional implementation issues arising from the language and its semantics. We have implemented a substantial fraction of CQL in a Data Stream Management System at Stanford, and we have developed a public repository of data stream applications that includes a wide variety of queries expressed in CQL.},

Our space bounds improve upon the previous best bounds of O(1/e\^{}2 polylog (1/e,N)). For counts, we present both deterministic and randomized algorithms. The deterministic algorithms require O(1/e log\^{}2 (1/e)) and O(1/e log\^{}2 (1/e) log eN) for worst-case space for fixed- and variable-size windows, respectively, while the randomized ones require O(1/e log (1/(e d))) and O(1/e log(1/(ed)) log eN) worst-case space, where d denotes the probability of failure.

In this paper, we focus on one particular type of adaptivity: the ability to gracefully degrade performance via "load shedding" (dropping unprocessed tuples to reduce system load) when the demands placed on the system cannot be met in full given available resources. Focusing on aggregation queries, we present algorithms that determine at what points in a query plan should load shedding be performed and what amount of load should be shed at each point in order to minimize the degree of inaccuracy introduced into query answers. We report the results of experiments that validate our analytical conclusions.},

abstract = {The querying and analysis of data streams has been a topic of much recent interest, motivated by applications from the fields of networking, web usage analysis, sensor instrumentation, telecommunications, and others. Many of these applications involve monitoring answers to continuous queries over data streams produced at physically distributed locations, and most previous approaches require streams to be transmitted to a single location for centralized processing. Unfortunately, the continual transmission of a large number of rapid data streams to a central location can be impractical or expensive. We study a useful class of queries that continuously report the k largest values obtained from distributed data streams ("top-k monitoring queries"), which are of particular interest because they can be used to reduce the overhead incurred while running other types of monitoring queries. We show that transmitting entire data streams is unnecessary to support these queries and present an alternative approach that reduces communication significantly. In our approach, arithmetic constraints are maintained at remote stream sources to ensure that the most recently provided top-k answer remains valid to within a user-specified error tolerance. Distributed communication is only necessary on occasion, when constraints are violated, and we show empirically through extensive simulation on real-world data that our approach reduces overall communication cost by an order of magnitude compared with alternatives that offer the same error guarantees.},

abstract = {A great deal of work on adaptive query processing has been done over the last few years: Adaptive query processing has been used to detect and correct optimizer errors due to incorrect statistics or simplified cost metrics; it has been applied to long-running continuous queries over data streams whose characteristics change over time; and routing-based adaptive query processing does away with the optimizer altogether. Despite this large body of interrelated work, no unifying comparison of adaptive query processing techniques or systems has been attempted; we tackle this problem. We identify three families of systems (plan-based, CQ-based, and routing-based), and compare them in detail with respect to the most important aspects of adaptive query processing: plan quality, statistics monitoring and re-optimization, plan migration, and scalability. We also suggest two new approaches to adaptive query processing that address some of the shortcomings revealed by our in-depth analysis: (1) "Proactive re-optimization," in which the optimizer chooses initial query plans with the expectation of re-optimization; and (2) "Plan logging," in which optimizer decisions under different conditions are logged over time, enabling plan re-use as well as analysis of relevant statistics and benefits of adaptivity.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of pipelined filters, where a continuous stream of elements is processed by a set of commutative filters. Pipelined filters are common in stream applications and capture a large class of multiway stream joins. We focus on the problem of ordering the filters adaptively to minimize processing cost in an environment where stream and filter characteristics vary unpredictably over time. Our core algorithm, A-Greedy (for Adaptive Greedy), has strong theoretical guarantees: If stream and filter characteristics were to stabilize, A-Greedy would converge to an ordering within a small constant factor of optimal. (In experiments A-Greedy usually converges to the optimal ordering.) One very important feature of A-Greedy is that it monitors and responds to selectivities that are correlated across filters (i.e., that are nonindependent), which provides the strong quality guarantee but incurs run-time overhead. We identify and study a three-way tradeoff among provable convergence to good orderings, run-time overhead, and speed of adaptivity. We develop a suite of variants of A-Greedy that lie at different points on this tradeoff spectrum. We have implemented all our algorithms in a Data Stream Management System and a thorough performance evaluation is presented.},

Our query class captures windowed join queries in data stream systems as well as conventional maintenance of materialized join views. Our adaptive approach handles streams of updates whose rates and data characteristics may change over time, as well as changes in system conditions such as memory availability. In this paper we focus specifically on the problem of adaptive placement and removal of <i>caches</i> to optimize join performance. Our approach automatically considers conventional tree-shaped join plans with materialized subresults at every intermediate node, subresult-free <i>MJoins</i>, and the entire spectrum between them. We provide a family of algorithms for selecting candidate caches, monitoring their cost and benefits in current conditions, allocating memory to caches, and adapting as conditions change. All of our algorithms are implemented in the STREAM prototype Data Stream Management System and a thorough experimental evaluation is included.},

abstract = {Continuous queries often require significant run-time state over arbitrary data streams. However, streams may exhibit certain data or arrival patterns, or constraints, that can be detected and exploited to reduce state considerably without compromising correctness. Rather than requiring constraints to be satisfied precisely, which can be unrealistic in a data streams environment, we introduce k-constraints, where k is an adherence parameter specifying how closely a stream adheres to the constraint. (Smaller k's are closer to strict adherence and offer better memory reduction.) We present a query processing architecture, called k-Mon, that detects useful k-constraints automatically and exploits the constraints to reduce run-time state for a wide range of continuous queries. Experimental results show dramatic state reduction, while only modest computational overhead is incurred for our constraint monitoring and query execution algorithms.},

abstract = {StreaMon is the adaptive query processing engine of the STREAM prototype Data Stream Management System (DSMS). A fundamental challenge in many DSMS applications (e.g., network monitoring, financial monitoring over stock tickers, sensor processing) is that conditions may vary significantly over time. Since queries in these systems are usually long-running, or continuous, it is important to consider adaptive approaches to query processing. Without adaptivity, performance may drop drastically as stream data and arrival characteristics, query loads, and system conditions change over time. StreaMon uses several techniques to support adaptive query processing. We demonstrate three of them: Reducing run-time memory requirements for continuous queries by exploiting stream data and arrival patterns. Adaptive join ordering for pipelined multiway stream joins, with strong quality guarantees. Placing subresult caches adaptively in pipelined multiway stream joins to avoid recomputation of intermediate results.},

This article presents an international selection of leading smart home projects, as well as the associated technologies of wearable/implantable monitoring systems and assistive robotics. The latter are often designed as components of the larger smart home environment. The paper will conclude by discussing future challenges of the domain.},

@techreport{ilprints618,
abstract = {Maintaining queues in a small and fast memory cache with large but slow secondary storage is an important problem that occurs in many contexts like DataStream systems $\backslash$citestream,aurora,eddies,gigascope,niagaracq, Network Router design $\backslash$citesundar,devavrat,george and Distributed Messaging systems $\backslash$citemqseries. At any clock-tick any number of tuples may enter the various queues, and a single tuple is consumed from the head of one of the queues. However since the number of unconsumed tuples may exceed the size of the memory buffer, some of the tuples in the queues will have to be written-out to secondary storage and then later read-in back into memory for consumption. The only constraint is that tuples written-out and then read-in should not be written-out again to avoid thrashing. The aim of the algorithm is to minimize the cost of the reads and writes to secondary storage. We provide online competitive algorithms for different cost models for reads and writes. For the cost model in which each read/write has unit cost (as present day disks are modelled) we provide a 2-competitive online algorithm and show a matching lower bound for maintaining a single queue. For n queues when a single read(write) can only access contiguous tuples from a single queue, we provide a 2n-competitive algorithm and prove a \{\$\}\backslash sqrt n\{\$\} lower bound if the heads of different queues are consumed in round-robin. On the other hand for adverserial consumption, we show that it is not possible to even have a o(M) competitive online algorithm, where M the size of the memory is much larger than the number of queues, n. However if the online algorithm is given extra M/2 memory then then we show a 2n-competitive algorithm. For the extended cost model where the cost of the read(write) depends on the number of blocks written out we provide a 4-competitive algorithm. These algorithms will be implemented in the Stanford Stream system},

abstract = { Research groups in both academia and industry have developed prototype systems to demonstrate the benefits of pervasive computing in various application domains. Unfortunately, many first-generation pervasive computing systems lack the ability to evolve as new technologies emerge or as an application domain matures. To address this limitation, the University of Florida's Mobile and Pervasive Computing Laboratory is developing programmable pervasive spaces in which a smart space exists as both a runtime environment and a software library. Service discovery and gateway protocols automatically integrate system components using generic middleware that maintains a service definition for each sensor and actuator in the space. The Gator Tech Smart House in Gainesville, Florida, is the culmination of more than five years of research in pervasive and mobile computing. The project's goal is to create assistive environments such as homes that can sense themselves and their residents and enact mappings between the physical world and remote monitoring and intervention services.

abstract = {This paper describes our ongoing work developing the Stanford Stream Data Manager (STREAM), a system for executing continuous queries over multiple continuous data streams. The STREAM system supports a declarative query language, and it copes with high data rates and query workloads by providing approximate answers when resources are limited. This paper describes specific contributions made so far and enumerates our next steps in developing a general-purpose Data Stream Management System.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing and executing multiple continuous queries, where each query is a conjunction of filters and each filter may occur in multiple queries. When filters are expensive, significant performance gains are achieved by sharing filter evaluations across queries. A shared execution strategy in our scenario can either be fixed, in which filters are evaluated in the same predetermined order for all input, or $\backslash$em adaptive, in which the next filter to be evaluated is chosen at runtime based on the results of the filters evaluated so far. We show that as filter costs increase, the best adaptive strategy is superior to any fixed strategy, despite the overhead of adaptivity. We show that it is NP-hard to find the optimal adaptive strategy, even if we are willing to approximate within any factor smaller than logarithmic in the number of queries. We present a greedy execution strategy and show that it approximates the best adaptive strategy to within a factor polylogarithmic in the number of queries and filters. We also show how the execution overhead of adaptive strategies can be reduced by appropriate precomputation. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our techniques.},

abstract = {We consider an environment where distributed data sources continuously stream updates to a centralized processor that monitors continuous queries over the distributed data. Significant communication overhead is incurred in the presence of rapid update streams, and we propose a new technique for reducing the overhead. Users register continuous queries with precision requirements at the central stream processor, which installs filters at remote data sources. The filters adapt to changing conditions to minimize stream rates while guaranteeing that all continuous queries still receive the updates necessary to provide answers of adequate precision at all times. Our approach enables applications to trade precision for communication overhead at a fine granularity by individually adjusting the precision constraints of continuous queries over streams in a multi-query workload. Through experiments performed on synthetic data simulations and a real network monitoring implementation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving low communication overhead compared with alternate approaches.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for finding frequent elements in a stream where the arrivals are not bursty. Depending on the amount of burstiness in the stream our algorithm detects elements with frequency at least t with space between ?O(F1/t2) and ?O(F2/t2) where F1 and F2 are the first and the second frequency moments of the stream respectively. The latter space complexity is achieved when the stream is completely bursty; i.e., most elements arrive in contiguous groups, and the former is attained when the arrival order is random. Our space complexity is ?O(?F1/t2) where ? is a parameter that captures the burstiness of a stream and lies between 1 and F2/F1. A major advantage of our algorithm is that even if the relative frequencies of the different elements is fixed, the space complexity decreases with the length of the stream if the stream is not bursty.},

abstract = {We are developing a general-purpose Data Stream Management System for processing continuous queries over multiple continuous data streams. When a new continuous query is registered, our query optimizer creates an initial query plan (possibly merged with existing plans for previously registered queries), and allocates initial resources, such as memory for join or aggregation synopses and for input and inter-operator queues. Dynamically, plans may be altered, resources may be reallocated, and scheduling decisions are made, all based on stream data and arrival characteristics, query plan execution behavior, and resource utilization.},

@techreport{ilprints668,
abstract = {In sensor networks, data acquisition frequently takes place at low-capability devices. The acquired data is then transmitted through a hierarchy of nodes having progressively increasing network bandwidth and computational power. We consider the problem of executing queries over these data streams, posed at the root of the hierarchy. To minimize data transmission, it is desirable to perform ``in-network'' query processing: do some part of the work at intermediate nodes as the data travels to the root. Most previous work on in-network query processing has focused on aggregation and inexpensive filters. In this paper, we address in-network processing for queries involving possibly expensive conjunctive filters, and joins. We consider the problem of placing operators along the nodes of the hierarchy so that the overall cost of computation and data transmission is minimized. We show that the problem is tractable, give an optimal algorithm, and demonstrate that a simpler greedy operator placement algorithm can fail to find the optimal solution. Finally we define a number of interesting variations of the basic operator placement problem and demonstrate their hardness.},

abstract = {We address the problem of computing approximate answers to continuous sliding-window joins over data streams when the available memory may be insufficient to keep the entire join state. One approximation scenario is to provide a maximum subset of the result, with the objective of losing as few result tuples as possible. An alternative scenario is to provide a random sample of the join result, e.g., if the output of the join is being aggregated. We show formally that neither approximation can be addressed effectively for a sliding-window join of arbitrary input streams. Previous work has addressed only the maximum-subset problem, and has implicitly used a frequency-based model of stream arrival. We address the sampling problem for this model. More importantly, we point out a broad class of applications for which an age-based model of stream arrival is more appropriate, and we address both approximation scenarios under this new model. Finally, for the case of multiple joins being executed with an overall memory constraint, we provide an algorithm for memory allocation across the joins that optimizes a combined measure of approximation in all scenarios considered. All of our algorithms are implemented and experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness.},

These engineers perform operations similar to database queries, but cannot use conventional data managers because of performance concerns and a semantic mismatch between the analysis operations and the operations supported by commercial DBMSs. Traffic analysis does not require fast random access, transactional update, or relational joins. Rather, it needs fast sequential access to a stream of traffic records and the ability to filter, aggregate, define windows, demultiplex, and remultiplex the stream.},
